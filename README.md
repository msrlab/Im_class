# AI Programming with Python Project

Image Classification for any category using pretrained networks from pytorch (torchvision)

## Usage
1. train network on a given dataset including train, validation and test images (see train.py -h for instructions)
2. check your trained model (see check.py -h for instructions)
2. predict class membership of a single image, given the trained network (see predict.py -h for instructions)
